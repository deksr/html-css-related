<p> Pseudo-classes
Pseudo-classes (along with pseudo-elements) let you style elements not just based upon their class, type, id or position in the document, but also their state. For example, whether an <input type="checkbox"> is checked or not.

Some common pseudo-classes are :active, :disabled, :empty, :first-child, :nth-child, :nth-of-type, :focus, :hover, and many more!

We can also chain pseudo-classes for extra good fun time! li:nth-child(3):hoverPseudo-classes </p><br> <br>
